# React-sandbox

A sandbox repository for all my React experiments. Maybe this'll be useful for someone in future who's hoping to see some simple React projects. 

I'm mostly going to be following this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) for this project. I'd highly recommend that people watch this if they wish to learn more about React!
