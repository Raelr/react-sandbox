# React-sandbox

A sandbox repository for all my React experiments. Maybe this'll be useful for someone in future who's hoping to see some simple React projects. 

I'm mostly going to be following this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) for this project. I'd highly recommend that people watch this if they wish to learn more about React! 

## Project Structure:

Currently, the project is comprised of three different sub-projects:

1. test-project
2. assignment-one
3. assignment-two

### Test-project

This is a sandbox project where I just test d=out different conceopts I've learned. There isn't really a set structure to this or a coherent application. This is entirely experimental and is largely non-sensical in the app. The point here is to learn and experiment with new React concepts. 

### Assignment-one

This project is based off an assignment that was provided in the above Udemy Course. This is a simple project - you have an input and output field. The inpiut field asks you to type in your name and the output field displays it. 

### Assignment-two

This assignment involves inputting a string into a text field. The inputted string will then be broken up into multiple characters which will then be displayed as spearate `divs`. Clicking on a character will remove the character from the original string and remove the div itself. 

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to a directory of your choosing. 
2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
3. Open up a project you wish to run and `cd` to it's root folder. 
4. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
5. Run `npm start` to start up the local server. 

Once these steps are done, you should be able to run all projects in this repository. Good luck and enjoy!
